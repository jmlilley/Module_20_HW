# Module_20_HW
homework for module 20

Module 20 is about supervised learning. For the homework, we were tasked with creating a logistic regression model twice. Both models utilized the same initial data; however, the second model also utilized the RandomOverSampler module since the variable we used for the y variable was so unbalanced initially.

The model was able to predict healthy loans very well for both models, but the model utilizing the RandomOverSampler module did a much better job prediction high-risk loans compared to the logisitic regression model with the original data.
